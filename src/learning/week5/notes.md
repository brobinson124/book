Notes

### App

* Data Template
	* Firebase hosts the template (idex.html for us)
	* Does FB get template or data first?
		* Template first data second
	* Whose CPU is getting the data and turning it into a list?
		* Client
	* What format?
		* JSON

* Heroku
	* Constantly modies the data (worker for us)
	* Heroku updates the information
	* Firebase pushes the update to the client
	* Can work as a server (we can host our template)
		* github can also serve, but it is static
